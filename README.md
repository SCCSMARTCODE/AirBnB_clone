# Airbnb Project

This project is a command-line interface (CLI) tool for managing properties and bookings in an Airbnb-like system. It provides functionality to create, update, and delete properties, as well as book properties for specific dates.

## Command Interpreter

The command interpreter is a Python-based CLI tool that allows you to interact with the Airbnb system. It provides a set of commands that you can use to perform various operations on properties and bookings.

### How to Start the Command Interpreter

To start the command interpreter, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command:


Here's a breakdown of the code:

- The `HBNBCommand` class has a `prompt` attribute that sets the command prompt string to "(hbnb) ".
- The `class_box` dictionary maps class names to their corresponding model classes imported from various modules.
- The `default` method is called when the entered command doesn't match any existing command. It checks if the command matches a specific pattern and calls the corresponding method if it does.
- The `emptyline` method is called when the user enters an empty line. It does nothing in this case.
- The `do_EOF` method is called when the user enters the EOF (End-of-File) signal, typically Ctrl+D. It prints a newline and returns `True` to exit the program.
- The `do_create` method creates a new instance of a given class. It checks if the class name is valid and then creates a new instance of the corresponding model class, adds it to the storage, and saves the changes. It prints the ID of the newly created instance.
- The `do_show` method displays the string representation of an instance. It checks if the class name and instance ID are provided, then searches for the instance in the storage and prints its representation if found.
- The `do_destroy` method deletes an instance based on the class name and ID. It checks if the class name and instance ID are provided, then searches for the instance in the storage and deletes it if found.
- The code you provided is incomplete, and the last line is cut off. It seems to be an incomplete condition for checking the instance ID and class name in the `do_destroy` method.

Overall, this code provides a basic command-line interface for creating, displaying, and deleting instances of different classes. However, without the complete code, it's challenging to provide a more detailed analysis or determine the overall functionality of the application.
